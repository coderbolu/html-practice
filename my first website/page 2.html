        <p><h3><em>This is really cool, I am building a web page where I share my thougts!</em></h3> </p>
    
    <span><p><strong>This is my first webpage, and I am pretty excited about Input.  HTML is an interesting topic. First, I learnt how to create the webpage,
    then to writing a title for the wegpage. As stated earlier, this webpage would serve as a personal diary, where I share my thoughts and observations.</strong></p></span>

    <p><em>I reinstalled Instagram app yesterday after about 3 weeks of being off the social media platform, because of personal reasons, lol.</em>
        I realized that I did not really miss the app. Scrolling through the app, I realized in fact that it was making me sad because of tons of tribute that is being paid to matthew perry, 
        a cast and star character of a TV show that aired for ten years (1994-2004). 
        I think what makes me sad the most is the fact that most or some of the lines he rendered in the tv series hits different now that he is really gone.</p>
        <p>The pain I felt in my chest while watching the short clips posted by some fan page can be likened to the pain I felt during the revelations of Mohbad's death, only this time it feels very real,
        and more personal because I relate more with Chandler and things he must have gone through. The fact that he had no one to share his pains with, maybe, because he was not married neither did he have any children.
        Being lonely and not having anyone to talk to or encourage one through a hard time can be really depressing. </p>
        <p> As I close today's input, I pray no one I know suffer same fate as Chandler. Also, my conviction to tell eveeryone I know to stay away from any form of addictive substance is strenthened, 
            that is, anyone that's willing to actually listen. </p>

            <p>Chandler, you'd always be remembered!. Looking at your pictures still hurts my chest, but I am glad the first entry on my web diary is about you. You are forever in our hearts</p>
            <p> Also, I was in a better mood earlier today even though my day didn't start so well. I was able to get some work done. 
                I understand that this journey won't be an easy one, but I would put my heart to it, plus with the help of YouTube tutorials and guidance from idiotic Jesse, it shouldn't be as rocky. So help me God, amen.</p>
    
    
            
            <div><h4>Entry Two - 3rd of November 2023</h4></div>
    
    <p><em> I woke up quiet early today in a bid to start my day early, so I can get to work on time, </em> little did I know that that would be the case. I intended that I would follow my boyfriend and alight close to the bank <em>so I won't spend so much on transport fare.</em>
        When I didn't hear from him after about two hours and time was not on my side again, I decided to go over, "maybe he was getting ready that was why he didn't reply me", so I thought. On getting there, he was just waking up, I just said hi and bye as I left for the bank myself.</p>
        <p> On getting to the bank, it wasn't as crowded as I'd thought he woud be, so I was happy, but almost two hours later, I was still waiting to be attended to by the customer service staffs who were working like they were there to waste our time. 
            As I heard my name, because one of the staffs registered curtomers who came in for complaints, I rose to my feet and walked the customer service section where I was attended to by a lady, who instead of attending to me immediately was doing something else.
        She attended to me after some minutes and told me the problem would be rectified in seven to ten working days. As I stepped out of the bank, rain has started drizzling, and I have not walked far before it started pouring down heavily. I had my umbrella with me, so I didn't scamper for safety, but I was drenched despite the umbrella.</p>
        <p> After everything, I got home around past three despite leaving the house some minutes to twelve, I prayed and broke my fast, ate my watermelon and tangerine while I commenced today's work around to 4. I hope to still get some work done, cover like four to five YouTube videos and move on to deeper topics in this course.</p>
    

            <div><h4>Entry Three - 4th to 6th of November 2023</h4></div>
            
        <p><em>Three days collapsed into this entry was the weekend, </em> I couldn't get any work done on Saturday because I had to help my sister with her business and on Sunday, well, I was just lazy, lol.</p>
        <p>The weekend was quite uneventful apart from the work I helped my sister with which lasted for about three hours, I had the talk with my friend Mide which went well because she got some things wrong and everything was sorted out. 
            She went ahead to make me a pic mix of our pictures together and wrote a note of encouragement on it and I thought it was cute, lol.</p>
         <p>Today, Monday, she sent me another video that has words of, motivation, so I will say she has been supportive, lol. I wanted to start working a bit earlier today, but I had data issues, and I was about to procrastinate working today, but I just regained myself. This new week has to be super productive. 
         I will probably stop working around  6pm today, so I can cook. I just know I have to finish everything HTML by Friday because I have to go somewhere on Saturday. So help me God.</p>

         
         <div><h4>Entry Four - 7th of November 2023</h4></div>

         <p><em>Today has not been as productive as I thought it would be.</em>I have not done a lot of work today, I spent early part of my afternoon on video call with my friends. It was nice catching up and having a bit of laugh.</p> 
         <p>I have to try to get some work done today, if not five hours, at least three hours or as the spirit leads, lol. At least I met my target yesterday and I hope to do better tomorrow. 
            The learning scheme is becoming more complicated and fun. I hope I am able to remember everything. I think I really need to start building a website, so I can practice these things not just for journaling.</p>
           
            <div><h4>Entry Five - 8th of November 2023</h4></div>

        <p><em>Today has been quite uneventful to be honest, </em> I did my morning routine as usual, started working a little late beacause I had to get something done. Oh, I am supposed to have broken my fast, but I want to finish this third video before that. I don't really have much to write at the moment, 
            I am just doodling, maybe before the day runs out, I will add more to it. Okay, nothing really happened except for me cooking the food we used in breaking our fast, going out with ife later at night to change his slippers and also going over to Doyin's to get my wig that she helped me adjust. 
            Oh, I was also on call with Doyin for over an hour, gisting and trying to encourage to take the leap of faith, lol. I am sure when it's time, she will do what is right, is it even a matter of what is right or wrong or actually just stop being afraid. Well, with time whatever it is, will happen.</p>

            <div><h4>Entry Six - 9th and 10th of November 2023</h4></div>
            <p><em>I did not get to input anything on the 9th of November because I did not even code at all,</em> my eyes and my headache were aching badly. So I was just off my laptop, not entirely though because I mean, I still saw a Big Bang Theory for leisure purpose, lol and that was all, I did not do any work. 
                Yesterday, the 10th of November because as at the time of this entry, it is already past midnight which means it's already 11th of November, but I just wanted to make sure I did this before going to bed. Yesterday was okay, I did some work before goingout with Ife to get some things; snacks that I would be needing later today for my picnic.</p>
            <p>Picnic I will be going to thanks to Ife, literarily. He got my dress, gave me money for tehe picnic and got everything aka snacks for my basket, I hope today would be fun sha because, omooooooooo. Oh yeah, I started building a website for my sister's business just for practice sakes, but I do raelly hope to do it well and also turn this one into a proper website.</p>

            <div><h4>Entry seven - 11th to 14th of November 2023</h4></div>
            <p><em>It has been a minute since I inputed anything,</em> I would have worked yesterday but thanks to stupid Nepa and not giving us light, it has been hard. Saturday was funnnnnnn, expect it started raining and the picnic ended abruptly, we played games, argued, insulted, vibed and gisted, lol. 
                Sunday was not all it, it was just there expect for the minutes I spent talking with Ife about tech and the future and money, lol. The no light nightmare started on Sunday. Yesterday, Monday I went to get my glasses because of the headache screentime has been causing me. Ife got me the cutest glasses and also picked one for himself. We also went to the supermarket were I got some things for personal upkeep.</p>
            <p>The heat yesterday was so unbearable, our water finished because there was no light, I had to come bath at Ife's then, went back home and as part of my trying to become a better person, I mended things with Ife because we had a misunderstanding. The last thing I did before going to bed yesterday was fetching water from well for my parents and for my sister and I incase we needed to use the toilet in the middle of the night. 
                I also woker up to fetching water for the house because there is still no light and our generator is faulty. Long story short, I am currently at Ife's becausetheir genrator was on earlier and I needed to charge. Electrity is very imporatnt, I think it's importance is not talked about enough or appropriately. It is truly a basic amenity that should by any means not be available to people at all times. </p>
