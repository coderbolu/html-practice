    <h1>Divs and Spans (with Classes)</h1>

    <div class="top-section">
        <p>I am starting a new topic, I am inside a div. Div helps personalize paragraphs and make them unique.
            They are for block of contents, they are boxes that hold stuff. While Span is used to control the range of words or paragraphs that you want to customize,
            it is basically used for styling. For example, I will use span on this line to differentiate it from others, and it can be used over and over again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bottom-section">
        <p>This is div number 2!. I am just doodling, so I can see know this div really works.
            Yeah, it did what I wanted it to do. DIVS are the building blocks of site.
            Classes are ways we can differentiate DIVS and paragraphs or any tags we have a lot of. It helps separate things. 
            Another thing that can be used to differentiate tags is "id". An ID is very similar to class. 
            The only difference is that it is more specific, and you can only have one "ID tag" per page, that is, you can not have a specific ID in different places. 
            It is a unique identifier, it is like the name of a person. It is advisable to use classes instead of IDs because it is less complicated.</p>

<H1>CSS Box Model</H1>

<h1>Colours in CSS</h1>
 <h2>Hex, RGB, & HSL</h2>
 <p> The use of hexidecimal is using hashtag '#' then writing the first letter of each colour twice, i.e use of numbers and letters to represent colours. 
        When there is a lot of zeros, the colour will be dark, when there is a lot of fs, the colour will be bright, i.e '000000 is black' and 'ffffff is white'. 
        NOTE: hexidecimal is a scale of A-> F i.e 0-> 9, F and 9 being the brightest, A and 0 being the darkest. E.g #RRGGBB -> #FF0000, it is written in doubles.</p>
<p>The RGBa scale is from 0-> 255, the 'a' stands foe 'alpha' which is pretty much trasparency, the alpha value is from 0-> 1. It is written just once and with commas. For example; RGB -> 255, 0, 0.</p>    
<p>HSL works like RGB, it has three values; 'Hue, Saturation and Lightness'. Hue value is 0-> 360 more like a 'wheel'. Saturation is in percentage, while Lightness is also in percentage. the HSL can used to manipulate just one colour. For example: hsl(360, 100%, 50%).</p>
    <!--the values of rgba and hsl must be written inside a bracket and separated with comma unlike hex-->
    <!--0% saturation gives 'grey'. the lower the percentage of the saturation, the closer to grey. While the higher the percentage of lightness, the brighter and the lower the percentage the darker.-->
    <!--you can also add the 'alpha' valuse to the hsl, it does the same thing as in rgb.-->
